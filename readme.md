# Typescript repository template: frontend flavor

Repository template for Typescript webapps with configs and tools I like:

- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) + [prettier](https://prettier.io/) with default settings running on pre-commit (thanks to [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)).
- Continuous integration using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

The `main` branch of this repo is pretty minimal and doesn't try to be opinionated towards frontend or backend projects.
